## React Cheatsheet

#### What is React?

- A toolkit that allows you to build the part of the website that users see and interact with.
- React is a JavaScript library (think of jQuery)
- JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- More efficient than writing in vanilla JavaScript
- **Declarative programming library** - uses functions/functional programming
- **Component-based** --> components give us a way to break down the user interface into smaller pieces (ex: nav bar could be one component, an article on the page could be a component, logo could be a component, etc.)

#### React in code

- React is written in JavaScript
- Uses special language called **JSX** (HTML-JavaScript hybrid/HTML-esque syntax for React) --> helps define structure of DOM using familiar HTML syntax
